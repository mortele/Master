\chapter{Artificial Neural Networks \label{NN}}
The following is a \emph{brief} introduction to the theory underlying the construction and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). For a more comprehensive review of the subject, the reader is encouraged to survey relevant chapters from the recent master theses of Stende and Treider \cite{stende,treider}. 


Raff s. 51: "NN (and other non-linear black box techniques) cannot be expected to \emph{extrapolate} accurately."
