\chapter{Implementation: Variational Monte Carlo}
The following is a description of the implementation of the VMC framework described in chapter \ref{VMC}. The main body and workhorse of the method consists of about $4\,000$ significant lines\footnote{As counted by the \lstinline{cloc} program which counts \emph{significant} lines of code, leaving out blank lines, comment lines, etc. \cite{cloc}} of \CC{}  code. It is object oriented and modular, and written to be as general as possible while still retaining execution speed. It consists of about 12 significant classes, with associated sub-classes, of which a generic user is required to interact with three in order to run simulations: The managing \lstinline[language={[std]c++}]{for i in srangse System system new valarray tuple} class,s ssss
